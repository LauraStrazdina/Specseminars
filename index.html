        Light is a form of energy. It is the type of electromagnetic ration like rays or radio waves.
        All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges. It is caused by the effect of oscillating
        electric and magnetic fields a so they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have
         both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case,
         the difference between various form of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist
         of particle, or packets of energy called photons. The difference between light and x rays for instance is
         amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic
         spectrum extending from low energy, short wavelength radio wave to high energy short wavelength gamma rays.
          Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible.

          We see light from the sun every day. Light is measured in ‘waves’ and the light that we can see
          is only a small portion of the types of light. They are measured in the ‘electromagnetic spectrum’.
          The human eye sees specific areas of the spectrum, but other animals and insects can actually see parts
          of the spectrum that we can’t.

          Light is an energy beam that moves in wavelengths. It is made up of tiny photons, each contains a
          lot of energy. The strength of the light depends upon the amount of energy each photon contains.

        Light doesn’t travel as fast when it has to pass through mediums that are different, such as air,
        water or glass. These mediums cause the light to ‘refract’ and that slows the light down. The
        refractive index of glass is 1.5, slowing the speed of light down to 200,000 km per second (124,000
        miles per second). Water has a refractive index of 1.3 and the refractive index of air is 1.0003. Air
        slows light down only a small amount.

        Isaac Newton studied light as it hit a glass prism. When he saw the light expand into the different colors
        (ROYGBIV): red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, violet, he realized that light refracts and each color traveled
        through glass (or other materials) at varying speeds. We can see the same thing happen when we see light through
        a prism or even when we see a rainbow. Each color within light has a different wave length.

      <div class="oneStory">
        Each type of light has a varying length of ‘wave’. Some animals can see ultraviolet light (UV) but the wavelength
        is not available for the human eye to see. Scientists have developed technology so that we can view UV light.

        Galileo Galilei was an Italian scientist that developed a number of scientific discoveries. One of them
        was the creation of a telescope that was thirty times the magnification of other telescopes. He used his
        telescope to look at many of the planets and discovered four of the largest moons that were orbiting around
        Jupiter. These four moons were called ‘Galilean satellites’.

              Natural light is the light generated naturally. The most common source of natural light on
              Earth is the Sun. We receive natural light throughout our sunlight hours, whether we want it or
              not. That is, we cannot control the amount, duration and intensity of the natural light. The light
              we obtain from Sun covers the entire visible spectrum, with violet at one end and red at the other.
               This light is good for our health and is necessary for plants to carry out photosynthesis. Fire is
                another source of natural light.

              Artificial light is generated by artificial sources, such as incandescent lamps, compact fluorescent
              lamps (CFLs), LEDs, etc. We can control the quality, quantity and duration of this light by controlling
               a number of factors. Artificial light is necessary for us to work during hours of low lighting (evening
                and/or night). The artificial light does not cover the entire light spectrum and is not too conducive
                to photosynthesis or health of life forms.
