      <div id="summary">
        Light is a form of energy. It is the type of electromagnetic ration like rays or radio waves.
        All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges. It is caused by the effect of oscillating
        electric and magnetic fields a so they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have
         both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case,
         the difference between various form of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist
         of particle, or packets of energy called photons. The difference between light and x rays for instance is
         amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic
         spectrum extending from low energy, short wavelength radio wave to high energy short wavelength gamma rays.
          Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible.

            <div class="text">
              Natural light is the light generated naturally. The most common source of natural light on
              Earth is the Sun. We receive natural light throughout our sunlight hours, whether we want it or
              not. That is, we cannot control the amount, duration and intensity of the natural light. The light
              we obtain from Sun covers the entire visible spectrum, with violet at one end and red at the other.
               This light is good for our health and is necessary for plants to carry out photosynthesis. Fire is
                another source of natural light.

            <div class="smallTitle" id="artificial">What is artificial light?</div>
            <div class="text">
              Artificial light is generated by artificial sources, such as incandescent lamps, compact fluorescent
              lamps (CFLs), LEDs, etc. We can control the quality, quantity and duration of this light by controlling
               a number of factors. Artificial light is necessary for us to work during hours of low lighting (evening
                and/or night). The artificial light does not cover the entire light spectrum and is not too conducive
                to photosynthesis or health of life forms.
