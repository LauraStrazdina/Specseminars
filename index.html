        Light is a form of energy. It is the type of electromagnetic ration like rays or radio waves.
        All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges. It is caused by the effect of oscillating
        electric and magnetic fields a so they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have
         both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case,
         the difference between various form of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist
         of particle, or packets of energy called photons. The difference between light and x rays for instance is
         amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic
         spectrum extending from low energy, short wavelength radio wave to high energy short wavelength gamma rays.
          Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible.

          The sun is a big star. At about 864,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) wide, it could hold 109 planet
           Earths across its surface. If the sun were a hollow ball, more than a million Earths could stuff
           inside it. But the sun isn't hollow; it's filled with scorching hot gases that account for more
           than 99.8 percent of the total mass in the solar system. The temperature is about 10,000 degrees
           Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) on the surface and more than 28 million degrees Fahrenheit
           (15.5 million Celsius) at the core.
