        Light is a form of energy. It is the type of electromagnetic ration like rays or radio waves.
        All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges. It is caused by the effect of oscillating
        electric and magnetic fields a so they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have
         both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case,
         the difference between various form of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist
         of particle, or packets of energy called photons. The difference between light and x rays for instance is
         amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic
         spectrum extending from low energy, short wavelength radio wave to high energy short wavelength gamma rays.
          Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible.

        Light is one of life’s necessities. We would not be on this planet if there was no light. When there is no
        natural light, we need artificial. And that’s how it is from the beginning. Some 400,000 BC Homo erectus
        finds fire, most likely by accident when a lightning hit a tree or a bush. Human development was born from
        that accident.

        First portable light was a torch - a branch or a bundle of sticks tied together with one end doused in a flammable
        liquid and lit. Around 70,000 first primitive oil lamps appeared. They were made from hollow stones or shells that
        were filled with moss soaked with animal fat. In ancient Greece they were first made from clay on a pottery wheel
        and then in moulds which gave better quality and enabled mass production. First candles were made in China in 200
        BC from whale fat with rice paper wick. Through time they were made from other materials too, like tallow, spermaceti,
        colza oil and beeswax until the discovery of paraffin wax which made production of candles cheap and candles
        affordable to everyone. Wick was also improved over time and made from paper, cotton, hemp and flax with different
        times and ways of burning.

          We see light from the sun every day. Light is measured in ‘waves’ and the light that we can see
          is only a small portion of the types of light. They are measured in the ‘electromagnetic spectrum’.
          The human eye sees specific areas of the spectrum, but other animals and insects can actually see parts
          of the spectrum that we can’t.

          Light is an energy beam that moves in wavelengths. It is made up of tiny photons, each contains a
          lot of energy. The strength of the light depends upon the amount of energy each photon contains.

                These fields have a right angle vibration to the wave direction of movement and

          Light doesn’t travel as fast when it has to pass through mediums that are different, such as air,
          water or glass. These mediums cause the light to ‘refract’ and that slows the light down. The
          refractive index of glass is 1.5, slowing the speed of light down to 200,000 km per second (124,000
          miles per second). Water has a refractive index of 1.3 and the refractive index of air is 1.0003. Air
          slows light down only a small amount.

          Isaac Newton studied light as it hit a glass prism. When he saw the light expand into the different colors
          (ROYGBIV): red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, violet, he realized that light refracts and each color traveled
          through glass (or other materials) at varying speeds. We can see the same thing happen when we see light through
          a prism or even when we see a rainbow. Each color within light has a different wave length.

        <div class="oneStory">
          Each type of light has a varying length of ‘wave’. Some animals can see ultraviolet light (UV) but the wavelength
          is not available for the human eye to see. Scientists have developed technology so that we can view UV light.

          Galileo Galilei was an Italian scientist that developed a number of scientific discoveries. One of them
          was the creation of a telescope that was thirty times the magnification of other telescopes. He used his
          telescope to look at many of the planets and discovered four of the largest moons that were orbiting around
          Jupiter. These four moons were called ‘Galilean satellites’.

              Natural light is the light generated naturally. The most common source of natural light on

               This light is good for our health and is necessary for plants to carry out photosynthesis. Fire is

               a number of factors. Artificial light is necessary for us to work during hours of low lighting (evening
                and/or night). The artificial light does not cover the entire light spectrum and is not too conducive
