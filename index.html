            Light is a form of energy. It is the type of electromagnetic ration like rays or radio waves.
            All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges. It is caused by the effect of
            oscillating electric and magnetic fields a so they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation
            is considered to have both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity
            and magnetism. In that case, the difference between various form of radiation is their wavelength.
            Radiation can also be said to consist of particle, or packets of energy called photons. The difference
            between light and x rays for instance is amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range
            of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum extending from low energy, short wavelength
            radio wave to high energy short wavelength gamma rays. <b>Light is the only part of the electromagnetic
            spectrum that is visible.</b>

            Light is one of life’s necessities. We would not be on this planet if there was no light. When there is no natural light, we need artificial. And that’s how it is from the beginning. Some 400,000 BC Homo erectus finds fire, most likely by accident when a lightning hit a tree or a bush. Human development was born from that accident. First portable light was a torch - a branch or a bundle of sticks tied together with one end doused in a flammable liquid and lit. Around 70,000 first primitive oil lamps appeared. They were made from hollow stones or shells that were filled with moss soaked with animal fat. In ancient Greece they were first made from clay on a pottery wheel and then in moulds which gave better quality and enabled mass production. First candles were made in China in 200 BC from whale fat with rice paper wick. Through time they were made from other materials too, like tallow, spermaceti, colza oil and beeswax until the discovery of paraffin wax which made production of candles cheap and candles affordable to everyone. Wick was also improved over time and made from paper, cotton, hemp and flax with different times and ways of burning.

            Oil lamps stayed pretty much the same until the 18th century and the man called Aime Argand. He was Swiss hemist and he made an “Argand lamp” which was improved variant of an oil lamp. It had cylindrical wick that gave larger flame and with that more light, it had an opening on the bottom that fed the flame with fresh oxygen and a cylindrical glass chimney that directed the draft from bellow and protected surroundings from the flame. In 1846, doctor and geologist Abraham Gesner distilled kerosene from coal and found that it is flammable and that it burns with much brighter light than oil.
            <br>
            <br>
            First kerosene lamps were independently made by Ignacy Łukasiewicz of Poland and Edwin Dietz of USA in 1853. They were designed to have container for kerosene, flat or a tubular wick or mantle and a glass chimney. After centuries of different but not too effective solutions for public illumination in 1792, inventor William Murdoch used gas distilled from the coal to illuminate his house. In 1807, London got a first street illuminated with gas lanterns. Gas lanterns were placed on the posts and lit and extinguished by hand every evening and morning. After that other cities of the world followed. Until electricity came.

            At the beginning of 19th century, Sir Humphry Davy set foundations for electrical lightning. He performed an experiment with a battery and a platinum strip, which made a connected strip glow. That was the beginning of an incandescent light lamp. After him, many inventors tried to improve incandescent light bulb until Sir Joseph Swann and Tomas Edison did succeed with a better vacuum and a carbon filament. After that, electric lightning spread the world and is still here today in the same and in improved forms.

            We see light from the sun every day. Light is measured in ‘waves’ and the light that we can see is only a small portion of the types of light. They are measured in the ‘electromagnetic spectrum’. The human eye sees specific areas of the spectrum, but other animals and insects can actually see parts of the spectrum that we can’t.

            Light doesn’t travel as fast when it has to pass through mediums that are different, such as air, water or glass. These mediums cause the light to ‘refract’ and that slows the light down. The refractive index of glass is 1.5, slowing the speed of light down to 200,000 km per second (124,000 miles per second). Water has a refractive index of 1.3 and the refractive index of air is 1.0003. Air slows light down only a small amount.

            Isaac Newton studied light as it hit a glass prism. When he saw the light expand into the different colors (ROYGBIV): red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, violet, he realized that light refracts and each color traveled through glass (or other materials) at varying speeds. We can see the same thing happen when we see light through a prism or even when we see a rainbow. Each color within light has a different wave length.

He used his telescope to look at many of the planets and discovered four of the largest moons that were orbiting around Jupiter. These four moons were called ‘Galilean satellites’.

              Natural light is the light generated naturally. The most common source of natural light on
              Earth is the Sun. We receive natural light throughout our sunlight hours, whether we want
              it or not. That is, we cannot control the amount, duration and intensity of the natural light.
              The light we obtain from Sun covers the entire visible spectrum. This light is good for our
              health and is necessary for plants to carry out photosynthesis. Fire is another source of natural light.
